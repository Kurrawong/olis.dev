# Olis API

The Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> application supports a number of [Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) with the main ones being:

* **Graphs API**
    * used to manage Virtual and Real graphs within an Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> instance
* **Query API**
    * used to receive and process queries asked of an Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> instance's data holdings
    * this API uses the Virtual and Real graphs of an Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> instance to send queries to Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> to the appropriate 'chunks' of data in the system
* **SPARQL API**
    * a standard [SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) query language and graph management protocol API
    * this API is usually access through the Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> Graph and Query APIs, but it's always there for you to use directly too

_More information about the Oli<span class="rtl">s</span> APIs, including standard documentation like [Open API docs](https://www.openapis.org/), is available with each Oli<span class="rtl">s</span>' built-in documentation and more will be available shortly, as Oli<span class="rtl">s</span>' availability status changes. See [Status](index.md#status)._
